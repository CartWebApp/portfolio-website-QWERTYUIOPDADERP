		<p>
			I am a high schooler with experience in software development.
			I have worked with apps (backend and frontend), websites (again both backend and frontend), and robots.
			I enjoy trying out new code and pushing the boundaries of what I can do.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first time I ever used code was back in elementary school with block coding - for games and LEGO
			robotics.
			As my age developed, my projects did as well.
			My block code transformed to html, css, js, java, xml, python, c++ and c#.
			I gained experience in web development, app development, and moved from LEGO robots to real ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			And now I’m here, with a website I’ve made, to show off things I’ve done.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please, look around!

		<p>
			Post college I plan to go into a software engineering job. 
			Ideally this job would be related to robotics, but I am open to other options, including but not limited to video game, backend, and front end development.
