        </p>
        <p>

            The Orwellian Present
            <br>

            “Big Brother is watching you”: a line that has carried its weight since it was written, holding the meaning of a powerful authority surveilling everyone, and controlling everything it can. And now, 75 years after George Orwell wrote this line in his novel 1984, it is more relevant than ever. In a world where technology is rapidly growing in capability and reach, it has become possible for actions to be monitored, people to be spied on, and information to be rapidly made up and distributed.

            A widespread and well-feared object, the telescreen is present almost everywhere in the world created by George Orwell. This device is the basis of the totalitarian rule in the novel, as it allows for the monitoring and control of all the country’s citizens. The telescreen acts as a television, but with a built-in microphone and camera. While functioning for the most part like an average television, the telescreen can also record video and audio. These functions allow the dystopian government of 1984 to call out those who behave abnormally, and to quietly deal with those who wish to oppose the norm. The telescreen, however, is lacking in a few fundamental ways. The most major flaw it possesses is its inability to move. A camera unable to move can be circumvented, and a microphone is useless if those around it stay silent. While telescreens are set up to best view the world, they are not capable of seeing everything. Winston, the main character of 1984, capitalizes on this weakness by “sitting in [an] alcove, and keeping well back” (Orwell 93). This immobility problem is compounded by the seemingly restricted range of the camera within the telescreen; the camera is only able to see ahead and so is unable to view anything to the side of the telescreen or behind it.

            While telescreens may not directly exist outside of fiction, some technologies could come disturbingly close in effect if misappropriated. Cameras, for example, can record video and often audio as well. This makes up the important part of the telescreen, meaning its main features could be reproduced. Modern cameras also deal with many of the problems the telescreen faces; some are capable of swiveling, and 360 cameras wouldn’t have any blind spots. Additionally, modern cameras can get remarkably small, with the smallest medical camera clocking in at one thirty-sixth of an inch, according to Omnivision, the company that made it. However, there are privacy laws that would prevent the government from placing cameras within everyone’s homes against the will of the citizens. In the event of an individual or separate entity with little regard for the law, the use of cameras could become more invasive. While wireless cameras could be hidden, they generally have a short broadcast range or need a separate object to help amplify the signal. In the event citizens know about the camera but are simply unable to do anything about it, cameras would face few problems with spying. All in all, cameras would likely function to an even greater extent and have a superior effect than the telescreens written about in 1984. Modern cameras outperform telescreens by effectively nullifying the flaws the telescreens faced, as being able to see in all ways or swivel dramatically reduces blind spots.

            Those who wish to hide from the overwhelming telescreens in 1984 may hope to head to more rural areas or the wilderness where telescreens aren’t commonly found. Even in these places, however, surveillance exists; in Orwell’s book, this takes place in the form of hidden microphones. When Winston heads into the wilderness to get some privacy, he knows full well that despite the lack of telescreens he is being spied on, thinking that “there was always the danger of concealed microphones” (Orwell 198). The hidden microphones are capable of recording audio and are very small and inconspicuous. This allows them to be stashed in places they won’t be noticed to record undetected. Microphones, unlike telescreens, are not able to record video, which makes them easy to bypass. People like Winston and Julia (the female lead of 1984), could simply avoid talking, perhaps writing notes to each other, and would remain undetected.

            Just like in Orwell’s dystopian story, microphones are very real in the modern worl. While not normally put to use to spy, the microphones of now are perhaps even more capable than those imagined by Orwell. Modern microphones can be very sensitive with long range. This would allow the microphone to pick up even the smallest sounds from potentially a large distance. Parabolic microphones, often used to listen to wildlife from a distance, utilize a unique geometry to capture audio in a singular direction to dramatically amplify sound, allowing for clear capture for hundreds of meters, as explained by Britannica. Microphones have limits, however. Small microphones have short broadcast ranges and lack great audio quality. Long-distance microphones require skill to operate, as a shift of a few degrees could misalign the spot they are listening to by many feet. While not the perfect listening device of 1984, microphones outside of fiction are capable of spying even better if implemented properly.

            When not spying on its citizens, the government of 1984 creates fake news and low-quality, mass-produced media to control its citizens. These pieces of media are created devices known as versificators. Versificators serve to automatically create “without any human intervention” (Orwell 217). The versificator is used to churn out trashy songs, news about sports and crimes, astrology, and much more. These pieces of media are then distributed to the Proles to keep them at some semblance of happiness and therefore keep them controlled. False information about the lottery is especially useful. The Proles all believe that a lottery gives out enough money for any of them to turn their lives around if they were to get lucky, which aids in keeping them satisfied with their current lives. However, all of the information about the lottery is made up, and no one ever wins the grand prize. The main problem the versificator faces is that it struggles to create anything new or even slightly original; everything it makes is basically the same as what it made the previous time.

            Similar to a versificator is modern AI. AI, especially LLMs (Large Language Modules) are capable of replicating human language, most often English. AI tools, most notably ChatGPT, produced by OpenAI, can be used to easily create false documents. These AI tools can be given detailed prompts on what to make, allowing for fake media that fits a certain bias. Going past the level of the versificator, modern AI is even capable of generating images and videos. Prime examples of tools to do such are Dall-E for images and Sora for videos (both created by OpenAI as well). In fact, the capabilities of AI-generated content are so large that companies have started using AI-generated ads; Coca-Cola has notoriously already run two completely AI-generated advertisement videos. The main problem AI would face in a dystopian world is censorship, as AI may forget information over time. This, however, could be dealt with by a competent software engineer. Overall, AI vastly exceeds the capabilities of Orwell’s versificator, being capable of generating content of a much wider variety, from text to images and even videos.

            The rapid growth of technology has led to fears of technological abuse, and these fears are well-founded. Modern technology could easily be used to observe people’s actions, spy on their conversations, and create false media and information. The capabilities of modern technology have long surpassed those available to the dystopian government of George Orwell’s 1984, and could easily be used by a government in this world to control its citizens.
