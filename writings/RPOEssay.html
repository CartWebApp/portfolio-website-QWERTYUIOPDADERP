            In Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One, technological advances offer school-aged students an element of educational choice; therefore, Wade opts to attend OASIS Public Schools. 
            Consider the pros and cons of attending school in the OASIS. 
            Should programmers around the world develop an OASIS-like public school system? 
            Why or why not?

            A Virtual Education
            <br>
            <br>
            In Ernest Cline’s novel, Ready Player One, the virtual world known as the OASIS has a public school system anyone can go to regardless of geographical or financial limitations. This virtual school system gives students safer, more inclusive, and more engaging ways to learn. Not only that, but its true power is in its ability to offer an immersive, emotionally supportive, and accessible education to everyone. Because of these benefits, programmers should work toward creating an OASIS-like virtual school system for real-world education.

            The OASIS provides a safe and comfortable learning environment, free from bullying and judgment. In traditional schools, students like Wade face bullying, shame, and social pressures. In OASIS, physical appearance and economic background don’t matter, creating a much safer and more inclusive experience - as Wade puts it himself: “Now, instead of running a gauntlet of bullies and drug addicts on my walk to school each morning, I [go] straight to my hideout and stay… there all day... In here, I [am] safe” (pg. 38–39). OASIS eliminates many real-world dangers and insecurities, giving all students a fair chance to succeed academically, regardless of their appearance or status, supporting the idea that an OASIS-like system would greatly benefit students everywhere.
                    OASIS allows students to experience interactive and immersive learning, making education more exciting and effective. With virtual simulations, students can witness historical events firsthand or explore ancient civilizations as if they were actually there, improving understanding and engagement, as shown in Wade’s world history class where the teacher “loaded up a stand-alone simulation so that our class could witness the discovery of King Tut’s tomb by archaeologists in Egypt in AD 1922” (pg. 52). OASIS-like classrooms would bring history to life in ways that traditional schools cannot. These incredible learning experiences would help students absorb information better and foster an improved relationship with learning - the main goal of physical schools that already exist.

            An OASIS-like education would make high-quality education accessible to students from all backgrounds, regardless of money or location. Wade's school was overcrowded and falling apart, like many others in his world. The OASIS not only removes those limitations but gives every student access to an advanced virtual campus and the tools they need, all without financial cost. The schools, not limited by the restrictions of the physical world, serve as “grand palace[s] of learning, with polished marble hallways, cathedral-like classrooms, zero-g gymnasiums, and virtual libraries containing every (school board–approved) book ever written” (pg. 37). OASIS defies the limits of money and space that hurt physical schools. By creating an environment like it where all students have access to the same top-tier resources, technology can equalize education.

            The OASIS public school system in Ready Player One proves that virtual education can be safer, more inclusive, emotionally supportive, and more engaging than traditional schools. It even solves larger issues like unequal access to resources and poor school funding. Ernest Cline’s novel makes it clear that virtual schools like the OASIS could play an important part in creating a better, more equal future for students.
