                A budget calculator was created to meet the needs of EECU. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They requested we use their api to take a list of jobs, the average income of said jobs, then provide tax rates to match. 
                Additionally, the calculator had to allow for the user to input expenses, then edit, remove, or add those or other expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The budget calculator was designed to operate on any device. 
                It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS to operate adaptive tax rates, and chartJS to show the data in a concise, legible form.
