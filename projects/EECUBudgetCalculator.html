                A budget calculator was created to meet the needs of EECU. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They requested we use their api to take a list of jobs, the average income of said jobs, then provide tax rates to match. 
                Additionally, the calculator had to allow for the user to input expenses, then edit, remove, or add those or other expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The budget calculator was designed to operate on any device. 
                It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JS to operate adaptive tax rates, and chartJS to show the data in a concise, legible form.
            </p>
            <p>
                The development of the budget calculator began with a competitive audit.
                I looked into other budget calculators on the internet, both popular and smaller.
                I then determined what made a budget calculator successful and popular - and what did the opposite.
                After making a list of necessary and beneficial features, I looked into what additional features my calculator could have that would make it better than the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was intended to be done with partners over a two week time, but I fell sick right as it started and missed the entire first week of development time.
                I chose to prioritize function over aesthetics, and worked on getting the api and calculations working.
                As such, the end design is very simple - but it functions exactly as it should.
            </p>
            <p>
                The need to use an api was introduced half-way through the project as a suprise challenge. 
                Since I missed the first week of development, it was introduced to me basically right as I was starting.
                The site needed to import list of jobs and their relevant salaries to then display as options on the site.
