            <p>
                I was tasked as part of a small team of four people to make a website and app for the supercar company Trion Supercars. 
                It was a team of two focused on the website and two focused on the app.
                I worked as a web developer and designer. 
                The website was made to work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices - anything from 4K monitors to the smallest of conventional phones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before working on the project a competitive audit was commenced, gaining insights on the websites of other supercar companies. 
                We looked into other supercar websites to glean info on how they constructed their sites.
                With that information we began work on our own site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website operates using pretty normaly with HTML, CSS, and JS. 
                It uses localstorage to simulate a cart and store. 
                We weren't provided what the official items or information should be for the online store, but were told that having one was necessary.
                As such, when shopping users will find that while they can add items to cart and check-out, they are unable to actually purchase anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the duraction of this project I worked with client requests to create keep the website and app to their satisfaction.
                Additionally, the website and app, despite being worked on by different people in our team, needed to maintain similar designs and content.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a long period of work, during which the other web developer ended up dropping out of the team, the website was completed to the expectations of the client.
