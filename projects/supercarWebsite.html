                I was tasked as part of a small team of four people to make a website and app for the supercar company Trion Supercars. 
                I worked as a web developer and designer. 
                The website was made to work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before working on the project a competitive audit was commenced, gaining insights on the websites of other supercar companies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The website operated HTML, CSS, and JS. 
                It used localstorage to simulate a cart and store. 
                We worked with client requests to create a website and app to their satisfaction.
