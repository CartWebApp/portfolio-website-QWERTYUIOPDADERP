                For a FRC robotics team I have worked on four robots.
            </p>
            <p>
                These robots were coded in java and made use of gradle.
            </p>
            <p>
                They required the use of control systems like PID.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each is designed to run a section where a driver controls it, meaning the controls must be intuitive and easy to use. 
                Each also runs an autonomous section, where the robot must operate independently of human interference - meaning the robots must have good odometry and be able to update using sensors and read external information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The robotics team is a group of around 70 people who must work together, and the programming team consists of 5-7 people.
