                For a FRC robotics team I have worked on four robots.
            </p>
            <p>
                These robots were coded in java and made use of gradle.
            </p>
            <p>
                They required the use of control systems like PID.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each is designed to run a section where a driver controls it, meaning the controls must be intuitive and easy to use. 
                Each also runs an autonomous section, where the robot must operate independently of human interference - meaning the robots must have good odometry and be able to update using sensors and read external information.
            </p>
            <p>
                The robotics team is a group of around 70 people who must work together, and the programming team consists of 5-7 people.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also worked on a scouting app, which was created with Java and XML through Android Studio. 
                It is designed to allow people to get and record information on other teams in order to scout out the competition.
                After getting information is converts it into a bitmap and from that creates a QR code, which is scanned and sent to a server.
                The stored information is then be viewed and sorted in a google sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been the Programming Director for two years now. 
                My job as director consists of training new members, creating documentation, effectively assigning jobs, working with other teams, and making the robot work autonomously and when driven by a person.
