                A website was created to advertise a fictional smart home. 
                First, a competitive audit was made into other housing companies and their websites. 
                This site used flexbox to organize data. 
                It operates using HTML5 and CSS3.
            </p>
            <p>
                A prototype was created using figma to plan out the design of the site. 
                The site was hosted on netlify.
