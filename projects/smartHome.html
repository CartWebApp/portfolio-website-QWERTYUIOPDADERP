                A website was created to advertise a fictional smart home. 
                First, a competitive audit was made into other housing companies and their websites. 
                This site used flexbox to organize data. 
                It operates using HTML5 and CSS3.
            </p>
            <p>
                A prototype was created using figma to plan out the design of the site. 
                The site was hosted on netlify.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start the project I preformed a competitive audit.
                I looked at various other sites used by housing companies.
                I took note of their design choices, wording, and what they emphasised.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the standard website development languages (HTML, CSS, and JS), I created a smarthome website.
                Said smarthome was supposed to reflect that which is found in the short story "There Will Come Soft Rains" by Ray Bradbury.
                It advertised the functions of the home as they were depicted in the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the first real project I created at CART, and also my first major experience using flex boxes.
                It has four pages - a home page and three different categories of features belonging to the smart home.
